# js-mutative-immutative-function
To learning mutable array function

# Background
About last month ago (08/2016) [react-sandbox](https://github.com/iamgoangle/react-sandbox), I started to learn React JS since it most popular in NPM trends also Google trend. React is a library, not a framework so I should be taken a lot of effort to learn it.

React does not prepared everything like a AngularJS Framework, the developer will be included which modules to them project by themselve.

In my opinion, it is good to let me realize about coding with non-framework is.

# What do I receive the knowledge from React JS?
Pure function should be not mutative the value that is the way of Reducer [http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html)

# What is the mutable vs immutable function?
mutable = when you change array inside any function, if array value has change. The source of array will change as well
immutable = just like a copy, any change will not reflect to source of value
